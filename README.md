# Cellular Automata

A Java-based implementation of cellular automata using LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). This project was developed as part of a school assignment for the Computer Science program at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS).

## Overview

Cellular automata are systems consisting of a grid of cells, each of which can be in a finite number of states. The state of each cell evolves over time based on a set of rules determined by the states of neighboring cells. This project visualizes the evolution of cellular automata using efficient rendering powered by LWJGL.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe the evolution of cellular automata live.
- **High-Performance Graphics**: Utilizes LWJGL for smooth rendering and efficient performance.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed to help understand and demonstrate the principles of cellular automata.
- **Meta UI**: Press ? for usage info
- **Save/Load**: Allows saving a board state to an outfile, and loading saved board states from file.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.
- LWJGL library properly set up in your development environment.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BenEklundCS/CellularAutomata.git
   cd CellularAutomata
   Configure your build tool or IDE to include LWJGL in the project's classpath.

2. Build and run the project:

  - Using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) or
  - Directly through your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
